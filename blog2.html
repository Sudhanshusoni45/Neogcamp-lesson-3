      <p>
        Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for
        goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies,
        often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good
        or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade
        tokens or casino chips. You’ll need to exchange real currency for the
        cryptocurrency to access the good or service. A cryptocurrency is a
        digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes
        it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many
        cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
        technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of
        computers. Now let us understand some terms which will give us a much
        broader perspective on what is Cryptocurrency and what is it’s use
        cases.

      <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
      <img class="img-blog" src="/images/Blockchain.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it
        difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A
        blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is
        duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems
        on the blockchain. Alright you all you guys are going all like that’s
        even i can google. So here is the simplified version of it. Blockchain
        technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known
        as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,”
        in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this
        storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.It’s nothing but a structure
        toe store all the transactional records. The most Popular Cryptocurrency
        is Bitcoin, now let us look into it.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
      <img class="img-blog" src="/images/Bitcoin.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        At a very basic level, Bitcoin is just a digital file or ledger that
        contains names and balances, and people exchange money by changing this
        file. There’s no gold or government issued money backing these numbers.
        Bob is only willing to trade his real-life lawn mower for a higher
        number in this digital file because he has faith that other people will
        also trust the system. So who maintains this ledger and makes sure no
        one cheats? One goal of Bitcoin is to avoid any centralized control, so
        every participant maintains their own copy of the ledger. One surprising
        consequence of this is that everyone can see everyone else’s balances,
        although the real system only uses account numbers and not names, so
        there’s some level of anonymity. If everyone maintains their own ledger,
        how are all the ledgers kept in sync as money is transferred? At a basic
        level, when you want to send money, you simply tell everyone else by
        broadcasting a message with your account number, the receiver’s, and the
        amount. Everyone across the entire world then updates their ledger.
      </p>
      <h2>Satoshi Nakamoto</h2>
      <p>
        No one knows who invented bitcoin, or at least not conclusively. Satoshi
        Nakamoto is the name associated with the person or group of people who
        released the original bitcoin white paper in 2008 and worked on the
        original bitcoin software that was released in 2009. In the years since
        that time, many individuals have either claimed to be or have been
        suggested as the real-life people behind the pseudonym, but as of
        January 2021, the true identity (or identities) behind Satoshi remains
        obscured. There have been so many speculations around this name, some
        have already claimed that they know who is Satoshi Nakamoto but failed
        to prove it. When Satoshi released the white paper in 2008 he fixed the
        amount of Bitcoin to be 21Million and he holds 1Million for himself. If
        you search for the wallet having highest Bitcoin in it you will comes
        accross a walet holding approx 1Million Bitcoin which people claims to
        be of Satoshi himself.
