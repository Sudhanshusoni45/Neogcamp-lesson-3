<p></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Journey so far</h2>



<p></p>



<p>I was born in blah blah and raised in blah blah i don’t want to bore with my Childhood and stuff like that so i am just gonna start with how my Entrepreneurial Journey Began.</p>



<p>After passing 12th and miserably failing in JEE mains i decided to take a drop and give it one more shot, and that’s when me and friend as many of you may know him Priyansh moved to Bhilai together and joined a coaching institute there and i know you wouldn’t believe this but i studied i studied Hard that year nevertheless i Failed again and that’s how i landed in Rungta College.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="677" height="225" src="./My Journey so Far – Sudhanshu Soni_files/Cryptocurrency-e1593344481720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-152" srcset="http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cryptocurrency-e1593344481720.jpg 677w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cryptocurrency-e1593344481720-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"></figure></div>



<p>By this time i had started developing interest in startups and doing something on my own something different yet i didn’t took any actions or steps towards it, so as usual i attended college hanged out with friends chilling and stuff so this went on for a while and one day i was hanging with my childhood friend Anmol and we got to talking about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00OWyA6IPn-xGLR6XITo31KhT1kLA%3A1593336776849&amp;ei=yGP4Xrm8M-KU4-EPhYyjuAc&amp;q=cryptocurrency&amp;oq=cryptocurrency&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIHCAAQsQMQQzIHCAAQsQMQQzIECAAQQzIECAAQQzIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBAgAEEMyBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQszNYpDlgz0NoAHABeACAAYMCiAHaCJIBBTAuMS40mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5wN2EmqTqAhViyjgGHQXGCHcQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5" target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a> (Bitcoin etc) he told me that he is making some Major Profit in trading it, so i got into crypto myself and at times there was some gains and some losses.</p>



<p>So,after trading for a while i came to know about cryptocurrency mining in easy words: you could generate these things without actually having to buy it, all you need is a computer and a decent Graphic Card ( GPU), at this time i finally decided to take steps and discussed this with my friend and roommate Priyansh, we did our Research and gathered some old stuff, Repaired a computer and some Fund then we Bought a Freakin 12000 Rupees GPU NVIDIA 1050Ti just for Mining purpose and Started the Mining Process. ( We were mining Ethereum)</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./My Journey so Far – Sudhanshu Soni_files/8115eXWTcL._SL1500_-1024x707.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-146" width="374" height="258" srcset="http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8115eXWTcL._SL1500_-1024x707.jpg 1024w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8115eXWTcL._SL1500_-300x207.jpg 300w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8115eXWTcL._SL1500_-768x530.jpg 768w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8115eXWTcL._SL1500_.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"></figure></div>



<p>So minings going on we were calculating that how much profit can we make and discussing future plans and expansion and all, everything was going smoothly life was good we were so sure that we are going to be Millionaires but then came the Biggest Crash of Cryptocurrency there has ever been, all our setup,investments, and Hope went to shit, there was no point in continuing mining.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./My Journey so Far – Sudhanshu Soni_files/Crash.png" alt="" class="wp-image-148" width="814" height="368" srcset="http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crash.png 838w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crash-300x136.png 300w, http://127.0.0.1:81/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crash-768x347.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px"></figure></div>



<p>We sold the graphic card on OLX  and then life was back to as usual attending college and stuff, but i had not dropped the Idea of start up and was determined that i don’t want do a 9 to 5 job, after a while i had Bought myself a Marketing course, but didn’t even started on that.</p>



<h2>Origin of YBM</h2>



<p></p>



<p>One fine day i was hanging at my Friend <a href="https://www.pranjal.wtf/">Pranjal’s </a>room also a Co-founder of YBM  at that time pranjal was working on his own Startup Meerakie so he was also super interested to do something, we were talking and i told him that i had bought a Marketing course so he was like cooool and all i don’t remember what exactly we talked but then and there we decided that it’s Time we do something it’s time to StartUp, we called <a href="http://praveshvyas.tech/">Pravesh</a> also co-founder told him everything, he was also in, so this was it just like that so simple, casual conversation in a friend’s room led to the formation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://yourbrandmate.in/" target="_blank">Your Brand Mate</a>.</p>

<p>Till now it has been pretty crazy Ride to reach here and now things are looking pretty Good, as of now we have worked with several companies,clients and still hustling everyday to provide value and High quality services.</p>



<h2>Concluding</h2>



<p>In the End i would just like to say you that work is a Huge part of anyone’s life so you gotta love the process and not the destination/result of what you do, you have to think about the kind of life you’ll be living on a day to day basis, is it going to be filled with adventure, challenges, setbacks, failure ,success or same kind of repetitive tasks every day every week.</p>



<p>Thank you for Reading, see you in the next one.</p>
